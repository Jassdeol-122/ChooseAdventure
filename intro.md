# Introduction

Welcome to the mystical land of Eldoria. You are an adventurer on a quest to find the lost city of Arcania. The journey begins at the edge of a dark forest. You see three paths ahead: a well-trodden path leading into the forest, a narrow trail heading towards the mountains, and a hidden pathway going into the dense undergrowth.
